This is a lesson on display propertys...which basically sets how an element is
displayed on a web page. There's also padding, border, and margin too.
Divs, as a 'block level element", are vertical, not horizontal.
Some are 'in line' level elements, which are usually horizontal.
For example: display: none; does not display the element.
display: block; just displays a block
display: inline-block; Just displays them as a block.

Padding shoots your content outwards...
Margin gives it some space from other content...

Also, if you give your element a class, (like dogone one over image),
the class takes precedent over any element level declarations,
(for instance, dog one has a dashed outline instead of groove).
