This is a lesson on display propertys...which basically sets how an element is
displayed on a web page. There's also padding, border, and margin too.
We also learn the 'Box Sizing' tool as well.

Divs, as a 'block level element", are vertical, not horizontal.
Some are 'in line' level elements, which are usually horizontal.
For example: display: none; does not display the element.
display: block; just displays a block
display: inline-block; Just displays them as a block.

Padding shoots your content outwards...
Margin gives it some space from other content...

Also, if you give your element a class, (like dogone one over image),
the class takes precedent over any element level declarations,
(for instance, dog one has a dashed outline instead of groove).

The web is nothing but a 'box model'. Everything is set up as boxes.
Just inspect anything on any site and you can see the 'content, padding, boder, margin' model.

Box sizing: border box. To make sense of this, the box goes on the 'outside'.
What it does is constrain images to a certain width that is defined.
This is essential for an orderly website. It will decrease the size of the content
if more stuff pops up on the page.
