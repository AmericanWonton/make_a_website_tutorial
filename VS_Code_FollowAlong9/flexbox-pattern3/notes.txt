In order to keep this neat and organized when resizing, here's what we need to do:

1. display: flex, flex-flow: row wrap;
2. What you want on each row should add up to 100.

In this example, the only 'flex items' are ONE AND FOUR. Right? Becuase they are DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE BODY CONTAINER, WHICH
HAS FLEX.
