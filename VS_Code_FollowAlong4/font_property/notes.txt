There's font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, and line-height

Leading = space between lines
Kerning = space between letters.

There may be some fonts that the User cannot have on some browsers...so we'll need to include some backups.

There's a <family-name> and <generic-name> that goes with fonts.
Differnent alternative fonts are seperated by a comma.

Deadass, you should use rem or vw instead of px for fonts...it sets a standard font size to scale for ALL browsers.
maybe don't use vw too much.

If your 'length unit' is 0, you don't have to include a unity like vw/rem.

Font weight is mostly good for bolding words.
Font style is for making something italic.

Some browsers have 'default settings' for certain elements. For example, on <h1>, google has all headers bolded, so you don't need 
font-weight added to it. If you'd like to change that, you can have a css-reset or put font-weight: normal.

Font-vairant and text transform are good for doing various special characters.

Line hieght gives you space between lines in an element.
