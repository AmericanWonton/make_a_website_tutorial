text align alinns the text
text shadow puts a shadow on stuff...duh

What's weird about text alingn center is it turns inline objects into block objects and cetners them...just take
a look at that first div and the image. 

Text shadow takes an offset x ratio and offset y ratio, a blur radius, and color.
So Text-Shadow example: text-shadow: 5px 5px 20px red;
