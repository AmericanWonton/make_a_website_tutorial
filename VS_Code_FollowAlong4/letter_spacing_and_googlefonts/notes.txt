The color CSS property only applies to text. Just google how to do line spacing, it isn't that hard.
Google font is a godsend...you can't have people doing searches if you make a bunch of images from photoshop.
Go to Google Fonts and see what some popular fonts are...they might be on the Users machine already and they won't have to download it.

After you selected a font from Google fonts, they instruct you to put the font link in your html,(ORDER IT BEFORE YOUR CSS.MAIN),
then also add it to your css.

To see how much traffic your generating with all your fancy files and network calls, open the chrome tab, right click
and go to inspect, then go over to developer tools, 'network' and do a hard refresh,(google it).
