Figure notes

A Figure is a self-contained content, frequently with a caption,(<figcaption>)
It's related to the main flow, but it's postion is independent of the flow; it could be moved to another page or apendix with 
no issues.
examples: image, illustration, diagram, code snipppet, etc.

An Address tag supplies contact info for it's nearest <article> or <body> ancestor; it should apply to the whole document.
