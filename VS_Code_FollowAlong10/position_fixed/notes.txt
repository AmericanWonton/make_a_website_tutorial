Position fixed is good for scrolling and shit....you ever see a site with a 
aside bar that 'follows' you? That's what it's good for, being 'fixed' within a 
relative postion.

A fixed position element is postioned relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. 

The viewport dosen't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is 
when the page is scrolled. (css-tricks)
