There's some expressions you can do while linking for multiple situations.
For example, below is when you are printing and you are between 600 to 899 px size.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="mq_600-899.css" media="print and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width:899px)">

You CAN'T use multiple media types,(screen and print, for example). You have to choose one.
