You can have element selectors,(which select an element to change properties on)
or you can have double assigned selectors,(whic mess with more than one element.)

Classes always start with a period. IDs are similar to a class, but should 
ONLY BE USED ONCE!


Selectors, selects attributes for certain elements.
For example, take a look at content editable. This lets the user edit
content.

Also, target=blank sets only the value it's set to.
