Flex wrap has 'wrap', 'no-wrap', and 'wrap reversed'.

People usually only use wrap and no-wrap 

The flex-direction is 'row' by default. You can also default it by 'column'.

Flex-direction can be set to 'row', 'row-reverse', 'column reverse', and 'column'. Row is the default, you use it 99% of the time.

Try changing the 'section' tag in css to the other flex-directions to see what happens.

This is somewhat important to know what 'axis' your flex-direction is workin on.
For instance, Flex-Direction Row = primary axis: horizontal and cross-axis: vertical 
AND 
Flex-Direction Column = primary axis: vertical cross-axis: horizontal


In short, whatever primary axis is in flex-direction, that's your primary axis
