For flex grow, as the content fills the container, it will grow accordingly for each item based on the size of the items.

So basically, you are setting the proportion that items within the container will 'grow' with each other when re-sizing the page.

uncomment flex-two 100percent width to see how much space that div takes up...
The order does NOT matter in the HTML with those two properties.

Flex shrink  defines the ability of the flex-item to shrink if neccessary

Note in the example with shirnking, if the flex-container is less than 100px, the shrinking kicks in.
