            <p>Beauteous she was, draped in a long black dress and silver sunlight, with long flowing black hair around her shoulders.
                So too was her skin, a velvet chocolate that shone with her bright grey eyes. The boy stuttered,
                trying to herald a worthy response for her. “Do you speak English?” she asked simply, beaming happily. 
                “I, yes,” said the boy, happy he knew that part. “I’m actually American. I just…what did you say?”
                He tried maintaining eye contact, as she giggled and swirled around…to turn and leave? No, here she was facing 
                backwards…bending out towards him. “I said, ‘toilet’,” she explained. The boy shivered, seeing a rump which
                blocked all exit and then some. “I imagined the word was quite…ohhhh…universal.” The dread hit him immediately…along
                with the silent, eggy stench. The young man could only muster the will to plead into her eyes, deviously winking
                as she slowly rose. The young man rose too, knees shaking as the realization hit him. “Yes Goddess,” he said
                promptly stepping out of his row as she begun to waltz down the aisle. “Thank you, toilet,” she said, not even
                bothering to address him with a glance. That was when the boy knew…she had him wrapped around her fingers. Goddess magic was real…this would not be the only taste he would get of it.
