        The boy looked out onto the European countryside. His destination was Belgium. In all honesty, 
        he wasn’t too sure what routes connected where. It mattered not. For him, satisfaction came from simply

        The hours passed in blissful peace, each new space in contest to see which would hold his memory the longest. 
        “Toilet.” He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to meet another contestant of beauty.
