Website makers make a lot of elements which do the same shit.

<pre> tag is for preformatted text, exactly as it's laid out in the file. However it's laid out in html, that's how it goes in
the preview for HTML.

<samp>  is intended to sample output from a computer program.

<code> is a fragment of computer code.

<cbd> represents user input and makes an inline element displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Careful! Some of these elements can be nested within each other and some cannot. Just read the documentation
if things get 'fuck-ey'.

abbr tag is for telling your user what some text is when you hover over it...they generally should be kept short.

<table> tag isn't really used anymore, but you can make tables with it.
<tr> is a table row. <th> is a table header.
