The general rule of web development is...ALWAYS INCLUDE THE META VIEWPORT TAG!...but there's more to it than that.

History of mobile devices and displaying shit:
Originally, web pages were just jammed down to the viewport...ugly af...you'd have to pinch and zoom.
Then, they started making the font size larger...font boosting.

To get a phone device display in developer mode of google...
Just click the little phone icon.

You can enable or disable font boosting at will, (see the paragraph element in this file.)
It all just depends on your preference...sometimes font boosting looks good! Other times, you'll want
it disabled.


This shit matches the width of the viewport with the width of the device! 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intitial-scale=1">

Intial scale means how are we mapping our css pixels to our 'device independent' pixels?
