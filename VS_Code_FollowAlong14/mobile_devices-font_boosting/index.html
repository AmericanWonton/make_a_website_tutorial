            The boy looked out onto the European countryside. His destination was Belgium. In all honesty, he wasn’t too sure what routes connected where. It mattered not. For him, satisfaction came from simply peering out his train window, watching one beautiful bit of scenery fade into another. The hours passed in blissful peace, each new space in contest to see which would hold his memory the longest. “Toilet.” He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to meet another contestant of beauty.
Beauteous she was, draped in a long black dress and silver sunlight, with long flowing black hair around her shoulders. So too was her skin, a velvet chocolate that shone with her bright grey eyes. The boy stuttered, trying to herald a worthy response for her. “Do you speak English?” she asked simply, beaming happily. “I, yes,” said the boy, happy he knew that part. “I’m actually American. I just…what did you say?” He tried maintaining eye contact, as she giggled and swirled around…to turn and leave? No, here she was facing backwards…bending out towards him. “I said, ‘toilet’,” she explained. The boy shivered, seeing a rump which blocked all exit and then some. “I imagined the word was quite…ohhhh…universal.” The dread hit him immediately…along with the silent, eggy stench. The young man could only muster the will to plead into her eyes, deviously winking as she slowly rose. The young man rose too, knees shaking as the realization hit him. “Yes Goddess,” he said, promptly stepping out of his row as she begun to waltz down the aisle. “Thank you, toilet,” she said, not even bothering to address him with a glance. That was when the boy knew…she had him wrapped around her fingers. Goddess magic was real…this would not be the only taste he would get of it.
Seconds flew by with alarming haste. The boy could not stop shaking, watching the mass of her booty flaunt side to side as she walked…and then stopped. “In, please,” she said gently, holding the lavatory door for him. The boy hesitated, hoping some fashion of strength would break her spell…but his feet said otherwise a second later. In the dimly lit space he squeezed into a corner. The Goddess had a much harder time entering such a compact space. Complimentary soaps were thrust to the floor by her butt; she grunted, breaking the mirror with her left cheek as her ass finally smushed inside. By some miracle, the door was finally shut. The Goddess sighed her ass finally angled in the young man’s direction. FFFBBBBBBRRRLLLTRROOAORUUARPPROUTT! Her bombastic toot flung up the dress, with a sultry chicken and sourdough flavor. The boy whined as he was forced to smell inches away. The Goddess caught her falling silk and pinned it in place upward; the boy was forced to cower on the floor as she begun separating her monolith asscheeks above him. “Boy, have you ever serviced a Goddess’s backside before?” she asked. PPPPPTTOURUUTT! The small fart carried a whiff of her spell…demanding he answer. “n-no, Goddess,” he whined. The Goddess sighed, pulling his head back to look at her. “It’s not as hard as you might have heard. Do not worry…I’ll be considerate.”
In an instant, she had her ass fall back, trapping him between wall and one large, bursting butthole. PPPPRRRRRTTTTTT! The boy whined, as a small fart announced the smell and shape of the horrific texture. “Ohhhhh…open.” He did so, not even compelled by her magic…he opened to scream, as the first of her waste begun to shove itself into his teeth.

            It was so long ago…that’s what the boy had to remind himself of. His therapist never believed a lick of his story…but his advice still helped. “Couch leather…steel knife,” he countered, heaving in the lovely smells of his apartment to counter the memory…and the very alive taste. “Pumpkin candle…pine-pineapple.” The young man froze, staring at the hunk of whole fruit on his cutting board. The shape was nearly similar…as was the size. He grunted, his mind relapsing back to the train ride…
The first push was the worst. He thought she meant to suffocate him in shit, reaching back into the start of his throat. The Goddess grunted, halting her progress. “Shhhh, dear, I know,” she told the cowering, gagging boy beneath her butt. She grasped wisps of what little hairs stuck out her ass, gently stroking his scalp. “Bite down and chew…then swallow.” BBBBRRRUUTTUURTTTTT! “Ohh…make sure to hurry.” For his survival, the boy obeyed. The taste was unlike anything ever done to him, ever. He’d rather have his fingers chopped off then chew her solid shit…he’d rather have his neck snapped or his teeth pulled out! FFFFBBBPPRRUURATTT! “Ohhhh,” the Goddess groaned. “My apologies, toilet. But hurry.” That fart pushed along another section of shit, along with her magical instruction. Through gags and disgusted belches, the boy had his tongue, (at least, sections not warded off by her wall of feces), shove the poo down his throat. The Goddess grunted, pushing off more sections…then more. The boy could barely tell if it was one whole piece or a collection set of shit logs she’d stockpiled. PPRRRUOURURTTT! BBRRALLAUFUFFRRTT! At least with chopped off fingers, the boy could bleed out…at least with a snapped neck, he’d be dead. “Ohhhhhhhh….”. PPTLTLRRRUUORRBBTTT! Here, the Goddess allowed prolonged sessions for him to chew and swallow, assuring he’d survive…but suffer greatly. “I can’-t…Goddess, I ca-UAGH!” The boy’s concerns were silenced by another large poo, caught between the back of his throat. “Almost…done dear,” said the Goddess, grunting and shoving her ass to suction deep around the boy’s skull. “Just hang tight…I’ll take care of the rest.”
The boy gulped…he appreciated the ability to do so, tasting only his saliva in the safety of his home. He liked soft music playing in his kitchen area…he liked the A/C on, even in the winter. He liked the cold…it was a stark contrast to the heat. The stinking heat surrounding his face…the never ending pressure of the Goddess and her booty. He gripped the counter, feeling the memory begging for the end.
He was allowed no oxygen as she shat. The Goddess grunted, snaking out the baguette sized poop directly into the boy’s stomach. He felt her fingers on his neck, grasping tightly as she shat. BBBRRRRUUUAALLRRUUAARLGBBRUTTT! “Oahhhh!” she groaned, wrapping her fingers tighter, kneading downward. The boy caught the gist of her actions…she was chopping up her monster shit within him! “Hold on boy…this should…get it…”. PPPRRROOTTLLLRRRUUABBRRUUATTTBBBBFFRRRUUUTTTT! The Goddess groaned in delight or agony. The boy screamed, feeling his lungs inflate with what felt like a burning, shit fueled sun. She finally rose, letting him gasp for air above her. “Large breaths,” she instructed, gesturing towards her stomach. “Like this.” The young man was too frantic to listen. The Goddess showed little concern, as she drug his head up into her asscrack. “I want to thank you, toilet,” she said, shoving the boy up along the length of her booty. The boy felt the contents surface from his stomach as she wiped. The Goddess took a moment to stop, pulling him out between her legs to look up at her. “What is your name, toilet?” she asked. He needn’t her fart spell to know that she wanted quick answers. “M-Mason…Reddick.” She smiled, lightly shaking him between her thighs. “Well I’m sorry train station chili fries don’t agree with me, Mason,” she said. “But the worst of it is over…almost.”
The boy whined as he was shoved back against her asshole, the poo on his face still drying. BBBBLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFF! He gagged, as the wispy fart pummeled his upper nostrils with a beefy hint. “That one is for the pain,” explained the Goddess. The boy groaned, as she propped open his mouth, her butthole poking onto his tongue. “This one is for…well, it’s not healthy to keep all that in your stomach.” FFFFFFFFOOOORRRRSSSSUUUSSTTTT! It was one of her worst, eggy and long, tasting of the deepest scent of her bowels. Before his vomiting could begin, she made sure to hoist him down into the toilet seat lid. “By my booty, I will return the favor for your kindness, Mason. Someday.” That was what he heard as she locked the door behind him, letting him vomit in and out of consciousness for the remainder of the train ride.
The therapist told him these relapses would be a common occurrence. The boy quickly sliced off a section of pineapple and chewed to soothe his nerves. He could taste the tanginess…but it wasn’t as sharp as he remembered. In fact, his whole nerves could feel the un-ease. This memory relapse was different. DING---DOOONNNG! The thought crossed his mind to not answer the doorbell…but a familiar voice commanded that he do so. Once again, the seconds were folded together into an array of fear as he turned the handle and stepped aside. Even at standing height, her figure drooped over with beauty. “Hello toilet,” the Goddess introduced herself…five years later.
